## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned new properties of flexbox such as flex-basis which helped me to make the images and text sections equal. I also learned how to do transitions such as the ones that appear when you hover over the desktop links. I'm also training my eye to look for fine details by constantly revising the code until the my version of the code (padding, margin, font-size, etc) looks very similar to the original design's without using the project's design files.

### Continued development

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is always a website I depend on when I need to refresh on flexbox concepts.
